This project was done at the Entrepreneur First Defense Hackathon in NYC in the immediate aftermath of the October 7th 2023 Israel-Hamas conflict, motivated by the urgent need for improved emergency response planning. It was inspired by my experience running statistical mechanics simulations and the class I was doing 16.410 Principles of Autonomy and Decision Making at MIT. The first picture shows where civilians get stuck based on the layout of the city and where to prioritise rescues.
